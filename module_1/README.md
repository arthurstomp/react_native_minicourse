# Module 1 - Introduction

## What is React Native

React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook that allows developers to build mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It enables developers to write code once and deploy it across multiple platforms, such as iOS and Android, without having to write platform-specific code for each.

React Native primarily uses native components for rendering UI elements, which means that it does not rely solely on web views. Native components are UI elements such as buttons, text inputs, and images that are rendered using the native APIs of the respective platforms (iOS or Android). This approach ensures that React Native apps have the look and feel of native applications, providing better performance and a more consistent user experience compared to apps built purely using web technologies.

However, React Native also provides a mechanism for incorporating web views if needed, using components like WebView, which allows developers to embed web content within their applications. This can be useful for integrating web-based features or displaying web content within the app. But the core UI elements and most of the app's functionality are built using native components.

## Expo vs Traditional React Native

This used to be a hot debate, but it seems that Expo found it spot and is now recommended by the official React Native documentation

> Many questions around this subject have been put to rest on this awesome [blog post](https://retool.com/blog/expo-cli-vs-react-native-cli) by Mathew Pregasen

We will be using Expo for starting projects.
